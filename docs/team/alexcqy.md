## Project: Reeve

Reeve is a desktop companion application for one-on-one private tutors designed to help them better manage their students' academic and administrative needs.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Feature added**: Added the **schedule** feature to **Reeve**.
  * What it does: Allows user to view classes on a timetable, rendered as a graphical user interface, either weekly or daily based on a date given.
  * Justification: This feature helps tutor to plan for their schedule and lessons either for the week or day. As is gives a whole view of the lessons ahead. 

* **Other enhancements**:
  * Added the `Name` and `Year` fields in the `Student` class.
  * Updated json storage to be compatible with `Student` object.
  * Updated the `add` command for users to add `Student` object. This allows user to add a `Student`'s academic and admin fields.
