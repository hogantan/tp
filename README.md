## Reeve
![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

**Reeve** is a desktop application for **private tutors to better manage both administrative and academic details of their students**, optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for receiving inputs while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for displaying information.

* Interested in using Reeve? Head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md)!
* Interested in developing Reeve? The [**Developer Guide**](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start!
